# Knapsack problem
# You're given a list of items that you want to bring into your backpack
# each items has the following attributes :
#   - size s_i
#   - value v_i
# You have a knapsack of total size S
# You want to maximize the sum of values for a subset of items of total size <= S
#
# 1) Subproblems : those will be the suffixes of items up i \in integers & remaining capacity X
# 2) Guessing : is item i in the subset or not? 2 choices.
#
# 3) We can establish the following DP recurrence :
#    DP(i, X) = max( DP(i+1, X) ,
#                    DP(i+1, X-s_i) + v_i )
#
#   We consider suffixes of items with the remaining capacity of the knapsack. We're either:
#   - not including it: in this case we simply lookup the next item with the same rem. capacity
#   - include it: look at next item and decrease current rem. capacity, add value of the item
#
# subproblems : there are say n items to consider \theta(n*S)
# spend O(1) evaluating DP(i, X)
# pseudopoly-time : \theta(n*S) (in terms of n as input size & S as a value)
#

# Naive recursive implementation

# McGill - COMP 251 final 2014
# Consider a row of n coins of values v(1) ... v(n), where n is even. We play a game against
# an opponent by alternating turns. In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin
# from the remaining row, removes it from the row permanently, and adds the value of the
# coin to his previous wins. Determine the maximum possible amount of money we can
# definitely win if we move first.
#
# c) Find a recursive formula for V(i,j) from (four) other values of V(i',j') (j'â€“i' is odd).
# Hint: When v(i),...,v(j) remain, only v(i) or v(j) can be selected. Notice also that we are
# trying to maximize our win whereas the opponent is trying to minimize our win.
#
# d) Write both an iterative and a recursive (with memoization) algorithm to compute the
# value V(1,n) using the results in b) and c).
#
# We now consider a recurrence relation where :
#   - I maximize the total possible amount I can make --ie. maximizing my chances of winning
#   - I consider my opponent to play the best he can
#
# Base case:
#   V(i, i+1) : we are comparing two consecutive coins, the obvious answer is to take the coin with maximum value
#   V(i, i+1) = max(v(i), v(i+1))
# For the recurrence relation, we consider the following:
#   - say I pick coin i, my opponent can either choose between (i+1) and (j). We know that he must play
#     the best as he can --ie. minimizing my chances of winning. Hence, he will pick coins such that my next move
#     has the lowest possible value.
#     - if he picks (i+1), I can choose between (i+2) and (j) on my next round;
#     - if he picks (j), I can choose between (i+1) and (j-1) on my next round
#   similarly
#  - if I pick coin j, my opponent has the choice of picking either (i) or (j-1). He must play such that he is minimizing
#    my odds of winning, therefore minimizing the possible value I can make on my next round.
#    - if he picks (i), I can choose between (i+1) and (j-1) on my next round;
#    - if he picks (j-1), I can choose between (i) and (j-2)
#
# V(i, j) = max( v(i) + min ( V(i+2, j), V(i+1, j-1) ) ,
#                v(j) + min ( V(i+1, j-1), V(i, j-2) ) )
